# Crypto-Price

My first Django project.

The homepage lists the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

The tracker page allows users to track cryptocurrency by using groups and setting a tracking price.

In the development pipeline:
- crypto homepage
    - email signup for notifications
- crypto historical data
    - allows user to query historical data
- crypto trading simulation page
    - allows user to simulate trading crypto with fake money
